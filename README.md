<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
<p>This website is designed to be responsive to different screen sizes and devices. The layout and content adjust to ensure that users have a consistent experience regardless of whether they are accessing the website from a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

To ensure responsiveness, I used CSS media queries to apply different styles to the website based on the screen size. I also utilized a responsive design framework to ensure that the website functions well and looks great on different devices.

I tested the website's responsiveness using various tools and methods, such as resizing the browser window and testing on actual devices. If you encounter any issues with the website's responsiveness, please let us know by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

Overall, I believe that ensuring responsiveness is crucial in providing a positive user experience, and we strive to make sure that this website is accessible and functional on all devices.</p>
